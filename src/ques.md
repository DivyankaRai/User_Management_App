Interview Project: User Management System
Objective: Create a simple web application that allows users to view a list of users, add new users, and update existing user details.

Features:

User List Page:
Display a table of users fetched from an API.
Each row should have a button to edit the user's details.
Add User Form:

Form validation: All fields are required. Email should be validated for format.
Edit User Form:
Similar to the 'Add User Form' but pre-filled with user data.
Ability to update the status and phone number.
Routing:
Use React Router for navigating between the User List Page and the Add/Edit User Forms.
Design and Styling:
Use Material-UI or Ant Design for the UI components and layout.
APIs:

Use JSONPlaceholder (https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/) for dummy user data. You can use the /users endpoint to get and post data.
Technical Requirements:

Use React for the frontend.
Use Axios or Fetch API for handling API requests.
Implement routing with React Router.
Use Formik or React Hook Form for handling forms and validation.
Use Material-UI (https://material-ui.com/) or Ant Design (https://ant.design/) for design components.
Evaluation Criteria:

Code structure and clarity.
Proper use of React and hooks.
Effective use of the design library for a clean UI.
Correct implementation of routing and form validations.
